to-do-graph
===========

A todo list where items are placed on an x-y grid. The axis can represent anything, but my personal preference is difficulty vs. due date. This way you could see items that are hard and due soon, or low-hanging-fruit that doesn't have to be done anytime soon.

This project began as post-it notes stuck to the wall in front of my desk at an old job. I started making a web app version as an excuse to use the [gridster.js](http://gridster.net/) jQuery plugin. Never finished, but I still like the idea and I should make an effort to finish something simple.

### To Do

* replace database with firebase
* users (firebase authentication and user management)
* edit axis labels
* add, edit, mark complete, clear items
