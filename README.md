to-do-graph
===========

A todo list where items are placed on an x-y grid. The axis can represent anything, but my personal preference is difficulty vs. due date. This way you could see items that are hard and due soon, or low-hanging-fruit that doesn't have to be done anytime soon.

I started this years ago but never got around to finishing it.

### To Do

* replace database with firebase
* users (firebase authentication and user management)
* edit axis labels
* add, edit, mark complete, clear items
